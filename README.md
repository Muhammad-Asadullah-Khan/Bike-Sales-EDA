# Bike Sales Data Analysis (EDA) Project
###### Overview
Welcome to the Bike Sales Data Analysis (EDA) project repository. In this project, I've conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bike sales data entirely within Microsoft Excel. The project involves importing raw data in CSV format, cleaning and transforming it, and creating various sheets within the same Excel file to facilitate the analysis with an interactive dashboard.

###### Tools Used
The primary tool used for this project is Microsoft Excel. Here's how it was utilized:

Microsoft Excel: Excel was used for data import, cleaning, manipulation, pivot tables creation, and dashboard development. It serves as the central tool for the entire data analysis process.
Project Structure

The project Excel file consists of four sheets:

1.Raw Data: This sheet contains the original bike sales data imported from a CSV file.

2.Working Sheet: The working sheet is where data cleaning, transformation, and data manipulation take place. This includes tasks such as removing duplicates, filling missing values, and creating calculated columns.

3.Pivot Tables: Pivot tables are created in this sheet to summarize and aggregate the data. These tables help in extracting valuable insights from the dataset, and they are a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis within Excel.

4.Dashboard: The dashboard sheet provides a visual representation of key findings and insights from the data. It offers an interactive interface to explore the data analysis results.
